        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Axis & Arbor began as a simple love for creating—shaping raw materials into something meaningful, functional,
            and built to last. What started as a personal passion quickly grew into a dedicated workshop rooted at the
            base of Pikes Peak, where traditional craftsmanship meets modern digital fabrication.

            <br>

            As a veteran-owned business, we bring discipline, precision, and pride to every project. Whether we’re
            crafting a hardwood cutting board, carving a custom sign, or designing a 3D-printed part, we approach each
            piece with the same commitment to quality and attention to detail.

            <br>

            Our mission is to bring ideas to life—combining creativity with technical skill to deliver work that feels
            personal, purposeful, and professionally made. We believe in honest craftsmanship, transparent
            communication, and building pieces that reflect the care and respect they deserve.

            <br>

            From carefully selecting materials to refining the finishing touches, every step of our process is driven by
            a desire to make something that lasts. Clients come to us for one-of-a-kind creations, precise custom work,
            and the confidence that their project will be handled with integrity.
            
            <br>

            At Axis & Arbor, creating isn’t just a craft—it’s a calling. We’re proud to serve our community and honored
            to build work that becomes part of your home, your story, and your everyday life.
